# Harry Potter Wiki

## Hello Potterheads üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

or maybe...

## Hello Gatsby fans ‚ö°

Since I'm a Potterhead I built this website
where you can see cool things about the Harry Potter universe.
You will find info about Hogwarts Houses,
the characters from the Wizarding World, the spells that Harry and his friends used to cast and also some
cool fun facts

You can see this cool side project [here](sergiosuarez.me/harry)

### If you want to test the site on you machine...

You just need to clone the repo

```
git clone https://github.com/Seergs/harrypotter-wiki.git
```

Since this is a Gatsby static site, just run

```
gatsby develop
```

Wait until gatsby builds the project and finally navigate to localhost:8000
